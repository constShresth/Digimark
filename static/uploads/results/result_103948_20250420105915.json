Phosphorus has 5 valence electrons, and each chlorine contributes 7\nvalence electrons. Phosphorus uses all its 5 valence electrons to form 5 bonds with chlorine\natoms.\n\nAccording to VSEPR theory, the five electron pairs (all bonding pairs} around the phosphorus\natom adopt a trigonal bipyramidal arrangement to minimize electron-pair repulsion.
