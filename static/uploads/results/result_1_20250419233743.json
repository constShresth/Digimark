The ground state electronic\nconfiguration of carbon is 1s? 2s? 2p. During hybridization, one electron from the 2s orbital\nis promoted to the empty 29 orbital, resulting in four unpaired electrons. The 2s and three\n2p orbitals then mix to form four equivalent sp? hybrid orbitals.\nThese sp? hybrid orbitals are oriented in a tetrahedral arrangement with bond angles of\n109.5\u00b0. Each sp? hybrid orbital of carbon overlaps with the 1s orbital of a hydrogen atom to\nform four equivalent C-H sigma bonds. This tetrahedral arrangement gives methane its\nstable structure and explains its geometry.\n(b) Lewis structure and VSEPR theory for PClz:",
