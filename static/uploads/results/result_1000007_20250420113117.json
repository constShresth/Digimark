Phosphorus uses all its\n5 valence electrons to form 5 bonds with chlorine atoms.\n\nAccording to VSEPR theory, the five electron pairs (all bonding pairs} around the phosphorus atom adopt a\ntrigonal bipyramidal arrangement to minimize electron-pair repulsion. Three chlorine atoms lie in the\nequatorial plane at 120\u00b0 angles to each other, while two chlorine atoms occupy the axial positions at 180\u00b0 to\neach other. The axial bonds are slightly longer than the equatorial bonds due to greater repulsion. The\nmolecular geometry of PCls is trigonal bipyramidal.",
